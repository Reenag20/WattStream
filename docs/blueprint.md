## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep Blue (#1A237E) to inspire confidence and stability.
- Background color: Very light blue (#E3F2FD), close in hue to the primary, to create a clean and calm visual base.
- Accent color: Muted Yellow (#FBC02D), an analogous color that complements the primary, will add a touch of energy to the design, for use in key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font known for its readability, should be used for both headlines and body text.
- Use minimalistic, geometric icons to represent different data points, alerts, and functionalities within the application.
- Implement a clean, split-view layout for the administrative dashboard, providing a clear division between consumer list and billing details.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to indicate data loading, status changes, and payment confirmations, enhancing the user experience.
